## Analysis
Temperature increases as we approach the equator. However, temperature peaks at around 20-22 degrees latitude, not exactly at the equatorial line. This may be due to the Earth's tilt in the axis known as obliquity.
There is alomost no correlation between cloudiness and latitude. It is almost distributed all around the globe.
Even the correlation between latitude and wind speed is very weak.
Humidity is consistently higher in the tropic but still not a strong corealtion with lattitude.
